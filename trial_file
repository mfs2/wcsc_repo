Another term that needs attention is “frontier.” Owen Lattimore, the historian of inner Asia, once noted that a frontier is not the same thing as a boundary.6 A boundary represents the intended limit of political power, the farthest extent to which a state or empire is able to exert its will on a geographical space. A frontier is the zone that exists on both sides of the boundary. It is a place inhabited by distinct communities of boundary-crossers, people whose lives and livelihoods depend on their being experts in transgressing both the physical boundaries between polities as well as the social ones between ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups. Frontier peoples—the Cossacks of Eurasia, the coureurs des bois of the Canadian forests, the mountain men of the American West, and many others like them—are not simply peripheral actors in human history but distinctive, highly adaptive cultures in their own right.

Attitudes toward these frontiers and their inhabitants can play a central role in the elaboration of imperial and national identities. The American historian Frederick Jackson Turner argued that the rolling conquest of the West shaped a unique American identity, a blend of European and indigenous traits forged in the harsh crucible of the frontier.
